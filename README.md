## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node LTS v20+
  - Verify version with `node -v`
- [generator-jhipster-react-native](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-react-native) installed
  - Install with `npm install -g generator-jhipster-react-native`
- [eas-cli](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/) installed with `npm install -g eas-cli`
- To run your app on an emulator instead of a device, follow the platform-specific instructions:
  - [Android](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
  - [iOS](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- JHipster backend must use `jwt` or `oauth2` for its `authenticationType`

### Usage

#### Generate React Native app from JHipster app

Create a JHipster app using `jhipster`, or a backend-only with `jhipster --skip-client`.

Create a directory alongside your JHipster app (ex. `client`), and run `rnhipster` in it.

```bash
+ rootDir/
  + backend/ # run `jhipster` in it.
  + client/  # run `rnhipster` in it.
```

Answer the prompts:

- Enter the path to your JHipster app (default: `../backend`)
- Choose whether to enable E2E Detox Tests

#### Generate JHipster app and React Native app at the same time

You can also create a JHipster app and a React Native app at the same time using the following command:

```bash
jhipster jdl bug-tracker.jdl --blueprints react-native
```

Answer the prompts:

- Enter the path to your React Native app (default: `../client`)

For available options, you can run:

```bash
jhipster-react-native app --help
```

### Configuration

- `app/config/app-config.js` contains your JHipster API URL (default: `http://localhost:8080/`)

#### CORS

- In dev, for the Web build, add `http://localhost:19006` as an allowed origin in the backend CORS config.
- In production, you will need to enable CORS for your deployment domain.

#### Notes for Android

- When running your JHipster backend locally for Android, make sure to run `adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080` so the app can communicate with your backend.
