## Websockets

A websockets example is present under the "Chat" menu item in the DrawerContent.  To enable this in your JHipster backend, Ignite JHipster made the following changes to your JHipster app's WebsocketConfiguration.java:

```text
src/main/java/.../config/WebsocketConfiguration.java
-registry.addEndpoint("/websocket/tracker")
+registry.addEndpoint("/websocket/tracker", "/websocket/chat")
```

The default JHipster websockets configuration requires users to authenticate before connecting.

For a more advanced websockets example, see the [tracker.service.ts][1] and [ActivityService.java][2] in the generated JHipster webapp.
